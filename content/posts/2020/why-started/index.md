I happened to find Matthias Ott's article titled [Into the Personal-Website-Verse][], which introduced me to a new way of seeing the Web. Posting content to social media never felt quite right to me, and I connected with a lot of the reasons that were presented in that blog post.

More reasons are present the indieweb wiki page appropriately titled [why][].
